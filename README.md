# AutoSSL
This script prompts the user for a hostname, and then asks the user to selct a domain. It then generates a csr and private key (.pem) based on the hostname and domain selected by the user. To use, just make file executable or perl autossl. 
 
## Variables 
@domains is a hardodedlist of domains to manage, I will get around to modifying to slurp a file/envars
